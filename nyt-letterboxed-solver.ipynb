Words must be present in the Oxford English Dictionary*, the last letter of the preceding word must match the first letter of the proceeding word, and subsequent letters in words must be on differing sides of the box (no concurrent letters from the same side of the box). Experts try to solve the puzzle with one (rare) or two words (often optimal).\n\nThis script tries to find one and two word solutions to the day's puzzle. Go to the NYT site, open the puzzle, and type those letters into this script. \n\n* The Oxford English dictionary has roughly 600,000 words. The two free dictionaries attached to this demo version of the script have 45k - 145k words (7% - 24%) of what is found in the the Oxford English Dictionary. These dictionaries can miss valid solutions because they don't have complete information.\n* The best \"Free\" alternative I've found is the RIDYHEW (Ridiculously Huge English Word list) that contains roughly 475,000 words (almost 80%).
